# Greetings, Git Travelers! 🌟

I'm Hortison, also known as the 'Commit Wizard' in certain coding circles. 🧙‍♂️

👨‍💻 By day, I'm a mild-mannered developer, pushing the boundaries of code and collaboration.
🌙 By night, I transform into a relentless bug hunter, seeking out those pesky critters in the depths of the codebase.

🔍 Currently exploring the enchanted lands of AI and Cloud Kingdoms.
📚 Expanding my spellbook with the arcane arts of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing.
🤝 Open to joining forces with fellow tech sorcerers on projects that could charm the world.
💼 Professional inquiries or magical debates? Summon me by creating an issue on this repo.
🎩 Fun fact: I think the suggestionn to use pronouns to identify yourself nuts.

Why do most of us ignore the chance? Connect with me for a spellbinding journey through the realms of technology!
